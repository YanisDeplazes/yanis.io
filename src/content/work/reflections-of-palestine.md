An installation displaying archival material from Palestine in a room with hanging mirrors. Small moments from Palestine—hopes, dreams, everyday life—become visible. Touching and turning the shards changes the light, awakening reflections and stories, and making the humanity, vulnerability, and resilience of the people palpable. A sensual, shared experience that invites reflection and feeling.
